# Bug Fixes Summary

## Timer Persistence Bug Fix (2025-01-27)

### Issue Description
The timer was getting restarted/reset when the widget was refreshed, losing all progress and session state. This was a critical issue for streamers who needed reliable timer persistence during their streams.

### Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation had several issues with timer state persistence:

1. **Auto-restart behavior**: When a running timer was restored after refresh, it would automatically continue running, which could cause timing inconsistencies
2. **Incomplete state restoration**: The timer state restoration logic didn't properly handle all edge cases
3. **Insufficient saving frequency**: Timer state was only saved periodically (every 5 seconds), which could lead to data loss
4. **Missing immediate saves**: Critical timer events (start, pause, reset, mode switches) didn't trigger immediate state saves

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced State Persistence Logic
- **Improved loadTimerState()**: Now properly handles all timer states (running, paused, stopped)
- **Smart restoration**: Running timers are restored as paused, requiring manual resume to prevent timing issues
- **Time calculation**: Accurately calculates elapsed time during refresh to maintain timer accuracy

#### 2. Immediate State Saving
Added immediate `saveTimerState()` calls to critical functions:
- `startTimer()`: Saves state when timer starts or resumes
- `pauseTimer()`: Saves state when timer is paused
- `resetTimer()`: Saves state when timer is reset
- `switchToMode()`: Saves state when switching between work/break modes

#### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added promise-based error handling for save/load operations
- Improved logging for debugging timer state issues
- Graceful fallback when no saved state is found

#### 4. Enhanced State Data Structure
The saved state now includes:
```javascript
{
  currentSession: number,
  mode: 'work' | 'shortBreak' | 'longBreak',
  remainingTime: number,
  isRunning: boolean,
  isPaused: boolean,
  timestamp: number
}
```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Key Changes Made:

1. **loadTimerState() Function**:
   - Always sets `isRunning: false` after refresh to prevent auto-restart
   - Calculates time difference to account for refresh duration
   - Properly restores paused state with visual indicators
   - Handles edge case where timer would have completed during refresh

2. **saveTimerState() Function**:
   - Added promise-based error handling
   - Improved logging for successful saves and errors
   - More robust data structure

3. **Timer Event Functions**:
   - All critical timer functions now call `saveTimerState()` immediately
   - Ensures state is always current when widget refreshes

#### StreamElements API Integration:
- Uses `SE_API.store.set()` and `SE_API.store.get()` for persistent storage
- Leverages StreamElements' built-in state management system
- Data persists across browser refreshes and widget reloads

### Testing Scenarios Covered

1. **Timer Running → Refresh**: Timer pauses and shows correct remaining time
2. **Timer Paused → Refresh**: Timer remains paused with exact time preserved
3. **Timer Stopped → Refresh**: Timer maintains current mode and session
4. **Mode Transitions → Refresh**: Correct work/break mode is restored
5. **Session Progress → Refresh**: Session counter and progress are maintained

### User Experience Improvements

- **No Lost Progress**: Timer state is never lost during refresh
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Paused timers show paused state after refresh
- **Manual Resume**: Users must manually resume running timers after refresh (prevents confusion)
- **Accurate Timing**: Time calculations account for refresh duration
- **Reliable State**: Immediate saves ensure current state is always preserved

### Performance Considerations

- **Minimal Overhead**: State saving is lightweight and non-blocking
- **Efficient Storage**: Only essential timer data is stored
- **Smart Frequency**: Combines periodic saves (5s) with immediate saves on events
- **Error Resilience**: Failed saves don't interrupt timer functionality

### Future Maintenance Notes

- Monitor StreamElements API changes that might affect storage functionality
- Consider adding state validation for corrupted data recovery
- Potential enhancement: Add user preference for auto-resume vs manual resume behavior

This fix ensures the Pomodoro timer widget provides a reliable, persistent experience for streamers, maintaining timer state across all browser refreshes and widget reloads.
