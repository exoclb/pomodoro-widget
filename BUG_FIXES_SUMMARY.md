# Pomodoro Timer Widget - Bug Fixes Summary

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Timer Restart After Browser Refresh/Crash
**Issue**: Timer would restart from the beginning after browser refresh or crash, losing all progress.

**Root Cause**: The `loadTimerState()` function was defined but never called during widget initialization.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `loadTimerState()` call to the initialization sequence in `onWidgetLoad` event handler
- Enhanced state restoration to properly handle:
  - Time elapsed since last save
  - Running timer continuation
  - Completed timer handling
  - Mode-specific duration and title restoration
  - CSS class restoration for visual state

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In onWidgetLoad function, added:
// Load saved timer state (if any)
loadTimerState();

// Enhanced loadTimerState() function to:
// - Calculate time difference since last save
// - Restore proper mode, duration, and visual state
// - Continue running timers or complete expired ones
```

### 2. Visual Glitch During Pomodoro-to-Break Transition
**Issue**: Visual glitches occurred when transitioning from pomodoro end to break mode.

**Root Cause**: Rapid DOM class changes in `switchToMode()` caused rendering conflicts.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Used `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth DOM updates
- Separated class removal and addition into different animation frames
- Ensured display updates occur after class changes are applied

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In switchToMode() function:
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  widget.classList.remove('timer-work', 'timer-break', 'timer-long-break');
  
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    widget.classList.add(`timer-${newMode.replace('Break', '-break')}`);
    
    // Update display after class changes are applied
    updateDisplay();
    updateProgressBar();
  });
});
```

## Technical Improvements

### State Persistence Enhancement
- Improved timer state saving every 5 seconds
- Enhanced state restoration with proper error handling
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing saved states

### Smooth Transitions
- Implemented double `requestAnimationFrame()` pattern for smooth visual updates
- Eliminated visual glitches during mode transitions
- Ensured proper CSS class management

### Robust Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks for state loading
- Graceful fallback when no saved state exists
- Console logging for debugging purposes

## Testing Verification

### Timer Persistence Test
1. Start a timer
2. Refresh the browser
3. ✅ Timer should continue from where it left off
4. Close and reopen browser
5. ✅ Timer state should be restored

### Transition Smoothness Test
1. Let a work session complete
2. ✅ Transition to break should be smooth without visual glitches
3. Let break complete
4. ✅ Transition back to work should be smooth

### Edge Cases Handled
- Timer completion during browser closure
- State restoration with expired timers
- Invalid or corrupted saved state
- Missing StreamElements API

## Files Modified
- `script.js` - Main implementation with bug fixes

## Compatibility
- Maintains full compatibility with StreamElements widget system
- Backward compatible with existing saved timer states
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact from `requestAnimationFrame()` usage
- State saving every 5 seconds (unchanged)
- No additional memory overhead

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding visual feedback for state restoration
- Potential optimization of save frequency based on timer activity
- Enhanced error reporting for debugging
